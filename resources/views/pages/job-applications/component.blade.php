                    a developer from Sale, Morocco (near Rabat).
                    I like to build and share things that add value or make a positive impact.
                    I love solving problems üß†, helping beginner developers üíª and ... more „ÉÑ.

                <p>
                    I currently work a full time job, and not that actively searching for a job.
                    However, when I saw
                    <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/about/careers/senior-php-laravel-developer"
                        target="_blank">this job posting</a> and especially the video on the

                        apply page</a>
                    I had to apply since this sounds like a great opportunity and a productive work environment
                    to work in.
                    That being said, let's get to my story and why I think we are a great fit for each other.
                </p>

                <h3>My story</h3>
                <p>
                    I started my journey in programming back at the university where I learned Algorithmic, C, Assembly,
                    Java and C#.
                    I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap later on my own.<br/>
                    After my graduation, I had 2 internships then I switched to full time trainer, as I had an amazing
                    experience teaching kids the basics of programming using
                    <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us" target="_blank">Lego EV3 Mindstorms</a> and
                    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>,
                    and a year ago, I was invited to talk about it, you can watch the recording
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/EpV5GA-kPos?t=1303" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started working as a freelance contractor afterward with a few companies
                    using PHP/Laravel and WordPress, where I learned so much,
                    then I decided to get a full time job and I did around the end of 2019,
                    which was a great experience because I learned to be a team player among other things,
                    after 4/5 months corona kicked in and the world switched to work remotely.
                </p>

                <h3 id="why-me">Why me ?</h3>
                <p>
                    I am the go-to PHP/Laravel guy at my current job, don't have all the answers üòÖ
                    but I know pretty much how to find them.
                    I love to experiment and discover new things,
                    improve the development environment to add value and make others developers lives better.
                    Here is a little bit more about that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I joined a team working on a project started 6 months before I came,
                        deadlines were tight, so I wrote a script which refreshes the auth token automatically,
                        so we can focus only on testing Apis, which helped the team reduce some manual "wasting-time"
                        processes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I Suggested Laravel and Git at my current job. An internal PHP framework and SVN were used
                        before.
                        Currently, I'm trying to convince them to use docker and something else for the frontend side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I created a list of bash
                        <a href="https://github.com/DrissBoumlik/desktop-config/blob/master/terminal/zsh/.zshrc"
                           target="_blank">aliases</a>
                        which helped few team members, You can read about it
                        <a href="https://drissboumlik.com/blog/how-cmder-made-my-life-easier-part-2" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since I work on projects with different PHP versions on windows,
                        I came up with a solution which allowed me to switch php versions on windows with one command.
                        I wrote about it
                        <a href="https://drissboumlik.com/blog/switch-php-version-on-windows-with-one-command"
                            target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Contribution</h4>
                <p>
                    I did some digging on the website and other IxDF links,
                    and I found the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/about#mission-statement" target="_blank">about</a> page
                    where you talk about your mission, which I really appreciate and want to contribute to,
                    I also found that you have published some public packages
                    on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation">Github</a> and
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://packagist.org/users/IxDF/">Packagist</a>, and I really liked it
                    because it means that not only you're providing the best expertise and quality content for learners
                    with affordable prices, but you're also creating what benefits the open source community,
                    and that gives me another reason for wanting to join you.
                </p>
                <h4>Community</h4>
                <p>
                    The idea of contributing, sharing knowledge, helping others, adding value, all these things
                    pushed me to host in-person workshops, create a
                    <a href="https://drissboumlik.com/community" target="_blank">community</a>
                    at the end of 2020 with a goal in mind to help Moroccan developers and build
                    a healthy environment conducive to learning,
                    where we hosted more than 120 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TeaCodema/videos" target="_blank">online</a>
                    events, thanks to +1.6k members and especially these amazing

                <p>
                    I started watching the video, and in the very first minute I heard this:
                </p>
                <div class="report-actions highlight-box px-3 py-2">
                    <p class="m-0">
                        We <span class="keyword">live and breathe our values</span>, and they form the

                        <span class="keyword">work culture</span>, What this means is that our values are
                        <span class="keyword">not just nice words</span> that we put onto our website,
                        They actually reflect and shape the way we <span class="keyword">behave</span>.<br/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first thing that popped up in my head was: <span class="keyword-2">"I want to work with these people !"</span>,
                    then I paused, because a question kicked in: <span class="keyword-2">"Do I really want to ?, I think the answer is in
                        the rest of the video!"</span>, so I ended up watching the entire video, twice, and I felt like
                    if I was sitting with you guys and talking to each other just like you said:
                </p>
                <div class="report-actions highlight-box px-3 py-2">
                    <p class="m-0">

                        So, please use this video as a sort of,
                        <span class="keyword">a conversational partner</span>
                        and <span class="keyword">continuously ask yourself</span>,
                        how you would fit into the culture.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    - <span class="keyword">"We always say that failure is an event, not an identity"</span>
                    and <span class="keyword">"fail forward"</span>
                    these words are spot on, and just hit me so hard, because I've dealt with many people,
                    especially new graduate who failed in their first job
                    or had difficulties to cope with the industry challenges, and tried to help them and mentor them in
                    a way to overcome these obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So YES, I do believe in these core values, from
                    <span class="keyword">"A culture of short-term execution that enables long-term thinking"</span>
                    to the <span class="keyword">"culture of grit"</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that being said, I hope this answers the
                    <span
                        class="keyword">"why you want to put your heart, mind and hard work into this particular job."</span>
                    and I hope you <a href="#why-me">think</a> I'm a good fit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's not all, there is more, but I hope I already convinced you enough to start a conversation.
                    I am looking forward to your response and feedback!
